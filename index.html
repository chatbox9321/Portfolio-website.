    <div class = "para"><p class = "script-1">The Itsukushima shrine is dedicated to the three daughters of Susano-o no Mikoto: Ichikishimahime no mikoto, Tagorihime no mikoto, and Tagitsuhime no mikoto. Otherwise known as the sanjoshin or "three female deities", these Shinto deities are the goddesses of seas and storms. Kiyomori believed the goddesses to be "manifestations of Kannon," therefore the island was understood as the home of the bodhisattva.[9] In Japanese, Itsukushima translates to mean " island dedicated to the gods"[2] In fact, the island itself is also considered to be a god, which is why the shrine was built on the outskirts of the island.[2] Adding to its sanctity, Mount Misen is "its tallest peak" ranging about "1,755 feet high."[2] Tourists can either hike or take a ropeway to the top.[2]</p></div>
